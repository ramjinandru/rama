DOWRY SYSTEM

The Dowry system is evil in society. It has reduced the sacred affair of marriage to a business deal. Brides are treated as a marketable commodity. The parents of the brides are often put under inhuman pressure for a handsome dowry. Sometimes they become pauper to get their daughters married. In many cases, young brides are ruthlessly tortured or pushed to suicide. To eradicate this social evil, a total change in the outlook of society is a must. The woman has to be considered as an equal partner of the man. Widespread education and employment and their rights of property can bring about the right remedy. Legal prohibition of dowry is not enough. Strong social disapproval of dowry is the only guarantee against this evil. Our youth should come forward to generate public awareness against this shameful custom.

Short Paragraphs #3
MY AIM IN LIFE

An aim is a goal or objective to achieve in life. In order to succeed in life, one must have a goal. My aim in life is to be a teacher. Teaching is a noble and responsible profession. I have come to know that the ever-increasing misery and distress, are due to the ignorance and illiteracy of the people of our country. So I have decided to spread education among the masses as much as possible within my humble power. As a teacher, I shall try my best to impart man-making education. Some say that money is the honey of life. But I do not agree with them. Rather, I think that morality is the real honey of life. I want to be a lovable and respectable person as a teacher in the future.
